## Overview

Python Zero to Hero is designed as both a **learning resource** and a **reference**. Each chapter delivers:

- A self-contained **HTML lesson** with code snippets and exercises.  
- A **Python demo script** (`chapterXX.py`) that you can execute to see concepts in action.  

Start at Chapter 1 to build solid fundamentals, and progress through advanced topics such as web development, data analysis, packaging, and more.

---

## Features

- **Chapters 1‚Äì10:** Core language constructs (variables, control flow, functions, OOP)  
- **Chapters 11‚Äì15:** Debugging, testing, concurrency, web APIs, data analysis  
- **Chapters 16‚Äì20:** Decorators, context managers, typing, packaging, databases  
- **Chapters 21‚Äì22:** Building web apps/APIs with Flask & FastAPI; CLI tools with argparse, Click & Typer  
- **HTML lessons** with syntax highlighting and Bootstrap styling  
- **Runnable demo scripts** under `src/` for hands-on experimentation  
- **Exercises** at the end of each chapter to reinforce learning

- **Root** contains all `chapterXX.html` files and the index.  
- **src/** holds Python scripts matching each chapter.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher  
- (Optional) A static-file server to serve HTML lessons  
- Internet connection for external CSS/JS (Bootstrap, Highlight.js)

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/bocaletto-luca/python-zero-to-hero.git
cd python-zero-to-hero
```

### Running the HTML Lessons

You can simply open any `chapterXX.html` in your browser. For best results (to avoid CORS issues), run a local server:

```bash
# Python 3:
python -m http.server 8000
# Then visit http://localhost:8000/chapter01.html
```

### Running the Demo Scripts

Each chapter has a corresponding Python file under `src/`. To run:

```bash
# Example: run Chapter 14 demo
python src/chapter14.py
```

They‚Äôll print step-by-step demos of core concepts, so you can experiment and modify as you learn.

## Usage Examples

- **Debugging and Testing (Ch 12):**  
  `python src/chapter12.py` shows how to use `pdb`, `logging` and `unittest`.  

- **Async I/O (Ch 13):**  
  `python src/chapter13.py` demonstrates threading, multiprocessing, futures, and `asyncio`.  

- **Web APIs (Ch 14):**  
  `python src/chapter14.py` sends GET/POST requests to httpbin.org.  

- **Data Analysis (Ch 15):**  
  `python src/chapter15.py` walks through NumPy and pandas operations, plus plotting.  

- **Packaging (Ch 18):**  
  `python src/chapter18.py` reads your `pyproject.toml` and inspects distributions.  

- **Web Apps (Ch 21):**  
  `python src/chapter21.py` runs embedded test-clients for Flask and FastAPI.
